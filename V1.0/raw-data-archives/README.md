Raw Experiment Data
===================

This folder contains an archive of the data used in the experiments
present in the final thesis writeup and the associated ICRA paper. The
experiments are performed within the Jupyter notebooks from the `notebooks/`
folder.

Unarchiving this data to a new `csv/` folder in the project root should enable
seamless replication of most plots from the thesis.

The archive is in 7zip format. If you're using Ubuntu, you can use
`sudo apt install p7zip-full` to install the appropriate utility for extracting
it.
